Let us take a closer look. \n\nIn Python, if a variable type is hashable, there will be a built-in method called *__hash__()*. One can treat the hash function return as a hashtag that uniquely represent the content of the variable in the memory. The hash search will use the hash function as *the Table of Contents* in a real-world dictionary to quickly determine if a complex element value is in a dictionary or a set:\n    * If the hash values of all set elements are not equal to the hash value of a query, then it is guaranteed that the query is *not* in the set;\n    * If the hash value of a query is equal to one of the existing hash values, then the search algorithm only needs to compare with those that have the same hash value.\n    \nIn other words, a hash function is a many-to-one mapping.\n\nTo achieve this goal, a variable will calculate its hash value at the inception of its values. As a result, Python does not allow a hashable variable to change its content after its creation. This is equivalent to putting contents in a dictionary: After the Table of Contents is created, the content itself is not allowed to change. Otherwise, the reference from the Table of Contents does not faithfully represent the content. \n\n**Consequently, we say that a set does not have a hash value because it is a mutable variable type. Furthermore, its elements must be immutable so that each of its elements has a hash value to facilitate fast search of the set elements.**\n\nLet us see another example below:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"Set = {[1, 2]}  # This assignment will return an error because adding a list (mutable) as a set element is not permitted","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Hash function creates a Table of Contents to capture a snapshot of potentially complex data content.

Hint: This value will need to be very large, due to the fact that Python 3 supports storing integers of arbitrary large value but a hash function value cannot be arbitrarily large. As a result, if your strategy is to increase the i value in a loop, it will be wise to adaptively change the step size such that the loop does not have to enumerate all the integers before the smallest integer value that satsifies the condition is found.\n\n\n2.
