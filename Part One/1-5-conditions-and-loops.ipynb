Exceptions are given to flow-control statements where the flow of the execution may be altered. Flow-control statements can be either selective (using if statements) or repetitive (using while and for statements).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# if-elif-else\n\nThe *if* statement allows a program to deviate from a linear order of execution, and can choose to execute different code blocks based on the evaluation of the condition as defined in the if statement. \n\nThe basic syntax of the *if* statement is as follows:\n\n    if CONDITION: \n        BLOCK_1\n    BLOCK_2\n    \nIn this code structure, if the CONDITION expression is True, then BLOCK 1 will be executed; if False, then BLOCK_1 will be skipped. Then BLOCK_2 will be executed regardless of the *if* statement. Please note that the result of the CONDITION expression must be a boolean value.\n\nAnother syntax involving the *if* statement is as follows:\n\n    if CONDITION: \n        BLOCK_1\n    else:\n        BLOCK_2\n    BLOCK_3\n    \nIn this code structure, if the CONDITION expression is True, then BLOCK_1 will be executed but not BLOCK_2; however, if False, then BLOCK_2 will be executed but not BLOCK_1. This order matches the English meaning of the phrase *if - else -*. After that, BLOCK_3 will be executed regardless of the CONDITION value.\n\nIn another syntax, an *if* code block can check a series of conditions sequentially. This is created by the use of the *elif* statement, a shorthand for *else if*:\n\n    if CONDITION_1: \n        BLOCK_1\n    elif CONDITION_2:\n        BLOCK_2\n    else:\n        BLOCK_3\n    BLOCK_4\n    \nNote that the above code is equivalent to the code below:\n\n    if CONDITION_1: \n        BLOCK_1\n    else:\n        if CONDITION_2:\n            BLOCK_2\n        else:\n            BLOCK_3\n    BLOCK_4\n    \nFirst, let us consider the following sample code:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"\nRock-Paper-Scissors Example Code\n\"\"\"\nimport random\n\n# Ask user to input R or P or S\nprint('Please input [R] Rock, [P] Paper, or [S] Scissors: ')\nuser_input = input()\nuser_input = user_input.upper()     # convert lower case to upper case\n\nif user_input !='R' and user_input !='P' and user_input !='S': # Doing sanity test\n    print(\"Input not supported\")\nelse:\n    computer_input = random.choice(['R', 'P', 'S'])\n    print('Computer input is ', computer_input)\n    if computer_input == user_input:\n        print(\"Draw!\")\n    elif (computer_input=='R' and user_input == 'S') or \\\n        (computer_input=='S' and user_input == 'P') or \\\n        (computer_input=='P' and user_input == 'R'):\n        print('You Lose!')\n    else:\n        print('You Win!')\n\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The code block implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game, in which the user's guess input is acquired in between lines 7 and 9. In line 9, we use the string type's built-in method *upper()* to identify lower and upper cases of \"R\", \"P\", and \"S\".\n\nWhen a program requires to process user input, it is highly recommended that the program always check whether the user input is within the expected range of input values. In the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, if a user inputs text other than \"R\", \"P\", or \"S\", clearly the input should be rejected out right because responses to other values are not defined in the game. In line 11, we see the first use of the *if* statement:\n\n    if CONDITION: \n        STATEMENTS\n\nNote that in the definition of the *if* statement, the CONDITION expression must be followed by a colon mark. This is because after the CONDITION expression and the colon sign, the code may include a block of multiple statements which will be either executed together or skipped together. Such statements who are bundled together are called a code block. \n\nIn addition to the use of colon, a code block also must satisfy the requirement of indentation, namely, all statements in the same block (and hence will be executed sequentially) must start with the same size of indentation. Note that Python does not explicitly set the amount of indentation, as long as all indentation in one code block is consistent. Further, Python requires that the very first code block that is at the same level as the first statement of the code must not have any indentation.\n\nThese requirements about the use of indentation to group statements into code blocks are quite unique in Python compared to many of its predecessors (such as C++ and Java).  A beginner shall pay special attention to the proper use of colons and indentation.\n\nNext, we use print() function to illustrate the change of the code flow under the *if* statement.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Level-0 code block')\n\nif False:\n    print('Level-1 code block')\nelse:\n    print('Another level-1 code block')\n    \nprint('Back to level-0 code block')","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Level-0 code block')\n\nif False:\n    print('Level-1 code block')\nelif False:\n    print('Another level-1 code block')\nelse:\n    print('Yet another level-1 code block')\n\nprint('Back to level-0 code block')","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# while Loop\n\nThe *while CONDITION* statement will check the CONDITION expression in a loop.

As a result, the program set the while loop condition to always be True. In each loop, the program will query user's input to ask whether the user would like to adopt one of the animals from the *animal_list*. This construction is called an infinite loop. In an infinite loop, the result can be finite so long as a termination condition is being checked inside the while block. In the above example, the termination condition is whether the user answers \"Y\" or \"y\" for agreeing to adopt an animal. When inside a while loop, the loop can be terminated by calling the *break* function. Upon executing *break*, the flow of the code will jump to the next statement after the while block.\n\nUsing *break* inside a while loop will cause the loop to abort without satisfying the while condition. In Python, a while loop can be coded to execute a block of code only if the loop exits normally, namely, the while condition is indeed equal to False. This is achieved by using the *while -- else* combination.

The for loop simply causes the loop index to enumerate the values of the elements from the list. \n\nAt this point, we shall highlight one major difference when setting up a loop using *for* statement compared to *while*. The index sequence defined in the *for* loop is created at the beginning of the *for* loop.
