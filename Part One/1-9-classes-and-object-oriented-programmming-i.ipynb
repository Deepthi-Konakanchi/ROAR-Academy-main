In this lecture and next, we cover introductory characteristics of Python programming using classes, a very powerful programming approach also known as **object-oriented programming** (OOP).\n\n* Encapsulation: In OOP, encapsulation means bundling the variable data and a set of built-in methods applied on the data together into a class object.\n* Attribute: A name reserved for encapsulated variables defined in a class.\n* Method: A name reserved for encapsulated functions defined in a class.\n* Scope: Every Python variable, function, class attribute and method has a scope, which refers to whether Python interpreter may locate the correct data value or function implementation in memory.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Encapsulation\n\n> The first purpose of creating a class is to encapsulate data values and methods applied to the data together.

Those functions defined in a class are also called **methods**, to differentiate from those stand-alone function definitions.\n\nAnother impact of encapsulation is to create a new scope of variable values that a program can access. Those variables associated with a class are called its **attributes**.\n    * Local: variables defined only in function code blocks.\n    * Global: variables declared in a *global* environment.\n    * Class: methods can access to its own attribute data by class or by its object instances.\n    \nLet us first see how a class is declared below:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Person:\n    ''' An example class to show Python Class definitions'''\n\n    retirement_age = 65   # Class attribute\n\n    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age = None):\n        if type(first_name)!=str or type(last_name)!=str:\n            raise TypeError('Person class initialzed with the unsupported types.')\n\n        self.first_name = first_name\n        self.last_name = last_name\n        self.age = age\n        \nx1 = Person('John', 'Smith')          # a Person-class variable is created\nprint(\"Instance attribute: \",x1.first_name)\nprint(\"Class attribute: \", x1.retirement_age)\nprint(\"Class attribute: \", Person.retirement_age)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-28T20:40:09.408829Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-28T20:40:09.409198Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-28T20:40:09.420902Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-28T20:40:09.409165Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-28T20:40:09.419622Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A class is declared using *class* keyword followed by its given name and then a colon mark \":\". Every Python class should have a built-in method called \\__init__(), which is called by Python automatically whenever an object of the class is created. For example, when we run a simple code:\n    \n    i = 5\n    \nThen the \\__init__() function of the integer class is called to create an integer object to hold the value 5. The process is automatic without need for the user to intervene.\n\nAn important task in the \\__init__() function is to initialize the class variables or attributes. In the example above, we see that three attributes are defined, namely, *self.first_name*, *self.last_name*, *self.age*. They are called instance attributes because each Person class object should have its own attribute values for first_name, last_name, and age. \n\nThe use of keyword **self** indicates the scope of the attributes is within each class instance, and the reference to the instance is indeed by the variable *self*, which is passed into the function \\__init__() automatically by Python without the need for the user to intervene. In the code above, when *x1* is created as a Person-class variable, *self* then will reference the variable *x1*.\n\nIn addition to *self*, we can see that the function __init__() requests two additional arguments: *first_name* and *last_name*. In this part, *first_name* and *last_name* without the prefix *self* represent the input arguments, whose scope is only local; while *self.first_name* and *self.last_name* with the prefix *self.* represent the instance attributes whose scope is only within each instance of the class.\n\nThe second type of scope in Python classes is called **class attributes**. In the example, *retirement_age* is a class attribute. The value of a class attribute is associated with the class that will remain the same for all class objects. A class attribute is defined in the same scope of other class methods, and it must be initiated with a default value at the time the class type is defined. \n\nIn the sample code, since *retirement_age* is a class attribute, we can query its value by referencing *Person.retirement_age* without actually creating a class variable. This is equivalent to querying the same attribute from *x1.retirement_age*.\n\nFinally, we see the case that not all instance attributes need to be assigned a value in function __init__(). In the sample code, *self.age* is initially set to a default value **None**. The value is a special *NoneType* class object. It is special in Python in the sense that there will ever be only one instance of the class. Any references of the NoneType value only point to the same object. Consequently, one can verify if the age attribute is None or is equal to None:\n\n    * x1.age == None     # When compare value\n    * x1.age is None     # When compare object ID","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class Person:\n    ''' An example class to show Python Class definitions'''\n\n    retirement_age = 65   # Class attribute\n\n    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age = None):\n        if type(first_name)!=str or type(last_name)!=str:\n            raise TypeError('Person class initialzed with the unsupported types.')\n\n        self.first_name = first_name\n        self.last_name = last_name\n        self.age = age\n\n    def set_age(self, age):\n        if age<0:\n            raise ValueError('age attribute in Person must be nonnegative.')\n\n        self.age = age\n\n    def years_until_retirement(selfish):               # The use of selfish is a joke, it serves the same purpose as \"self\"\n        until_retirement_year = Person.retirement_age - selfish.age\n        if until_retirement_year<=0:\n            print('This person has retired')\n        else:\n            print('This person has {0} years until retirement'.format(until_retirement_year))\n        \nx1 = Person('John', 'Smith')\nPerson.retirement_age = 80\nx1.retirement_age = 65\nprint(x1.retirement_age)\nprint(Person.retirement_age)\n\nx1.age = 40\n\nx1.years_until_retirement()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-23T16:37:53.560956Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-23T16:37:53.561334Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-23T16:37:53.575051Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-23T16:37:53.561298Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-23T16:37:53.573822Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Next, we expand the definition of the Person class, and see examples of how instance attributes and class attributes are updated by the class' methods.\n\nFirst, it may come as a surprise that Python does not have protected status for attributes in classes. As such, the value of any attribute can be freely queried or assigned to new values outside the class definition.\n\nOn the other hand, directly altering attributes of a class is not recommended in OOP. One leading reason is that the attribute values may need to satisfy some conditions for it to be valid. For example, it is reasonable to require that a person's age is nonnegative. So if the *age* attribute is modified outside the class, this condition may not be enforced, and the object may end up storing an invalid attribute value.\n\nA principled way to remedy this concern is to provide built-in methods to update class attributes. In the built-in methods then, all the boundary conditions that concern the validity of the attribute value should be imposed. One example if the method *set_age()* in the Person class. In its definition, it first checks if an age input is nonnegative. Only when the input argument passes this condition, then the attribute value is updated. Otherwise, it will raise a runtime error using the function *ValueError()*.\n\nTo update an instance attribute, Python needs to pass in a reference of the instance object when the object's attribute is being updated, because the scope of an instance attribute is only within that particular class instance. We can see in *set_age(self, age)*, this is done by passing in the first argument as *self*. Once the method is defined with the first argument used for referencing a class instance, the passing of the instance reference is automatic by Python and it does not require user's intervention.\n\nA somewhat unexpected rule in Python is that *self* itself is not a reserved keyword, it is merely the first argument included in class methods that need a reference to its class instance. To this end, the argument actually can be called by any valid variable name. For example, in the subsequent method definition *years_until_retirement()*, for just the purpose of making this point, we rename this argument \"selfish\". Hence, referencing the instance attribute *age* will become *selfish.age* instead of *self.age*. \n\nNote that the fact that the reference to a class instance \"self\" can be renamed to other valid name does not mean that practitioners should pursue this option at will. Using the naming \"self\" is universally adopted by most programmers. Therefore, following this naming convention improves the readability of your code when shared with others.\n\nIn the same function *years_until_retirement()*, we also see how the function can reference a class attribute *retirement_age*. This is done by providing the class name as the prefix: *Person.retirement_age*. Since *retirement_age* is shared by all instances of the class, *Person.retirement_age* is a proper way to reference it.

There are three types:\n\n    * Instance Methods: Most common method type in class definition. They interact with instance attributes via \"self\" reference variable.\n    * Class Methods: They interact with class attributes and other class methods via \"@classmethod\" decorator.\n    * Static Methods: Typically utility functions that do not interact with either instance or class attributes. The decorator is \"@staticmethod\".\n    \nIn the above expanded Person class, we can see the declaration of a class method called *fromBirth()*. When a method is declared as a class method, the first argument passed into the function will reference the class itself but not the individual instances. Because of this reason, by naming convention practitioners have chosen a different name called \"cls\", rather than using \"self\" for those instance methods. \n\nThe purpose of the class method *fromBirth()* is quite useful for classes. When a code creates a class object, if we need to have alternative ways to initialize the object, we can define a class method with a different set of arguments. In the above example, the argument for calculating the age of a person is provided by their birth year. Therefore, one can indirectly calculate the age by using the current year minus the birth year. The imported module date has a built-in function *today()* to read today's date from the computer. The return then has an attribute called year.\n\nSince \"cls\" references the Person class, then the following statement will trigger Python to call the default *\\__init__()* method with the proper age now calculated from the birth year:\n\n    cls(first_name, last_name, date.today().year - birth_year)\n    \n    \nWe also see an example of static methods. Static methods do not carry any references to the class or its instances in its argument list. It is a convenient place to encapsulate useful utility functions. In the above example, validating whether an age is greater than 18 is a useful utility function to describe a person, but the condition is independently verified separated from any instance or class attributes.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Finally, we examine the mutability of class objects.
