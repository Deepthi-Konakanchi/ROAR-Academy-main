A boolean type value is the return output from a comparison operator if executed properly.\n\nThe following comparison operators in Python directly match to those same operators in arithmetic: <, <=, >, >=. \"is equal to\" comparison is denoted as \"==\", while \"is not equal to\" is denoated as \"!=\"\n\nNow let us dissect the five returns. The first two comparison results are trivial as just toy examples. The third comparison essentially tests whether (4//2) = 2 is equal to 2, which leads to return value True. However, we further observe in the fourth comparison that (4/2) = 2.0 (in here we simply recall that \"/\" in Python represents floating-point division, so the returning result is always a float, namely, with fraction portion even in cases that the fractional part is zero). So Python evaluation is telling us that 2.0 == 2. This verifies that comparison operators only compare their value magnitudes, but not their types or any other things. From the value magnitude, 2.0 and 2 are equal (but they are not equivalent, as we will soon see below).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(True == 1)\nprint(False == 0)\nprint(type(True))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The above two statements further review how boolean values are stored in computer.

Clearly, the type of integer and the type of boolean are not equivalent or identical.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Variables in Python\n\nIn computer, programs and data are stored in its memory space. When a program needs to use the data, such as an integer value of 3 after the calculation of 5-2, the program needs a convenient way to reference the location of the data 3 stored in the memory. \n\nOne direct way to reference memory data is to declare its memory address, which will be a number starting from zero referencing the first **byte** of the memory, and so on and so forth. Byte is the fundamental memory unit when referencing and retrieving data in all modern computer systems. One byte contains a sequence of 8 bits, and 1 bit represents a single number of either 0 or 1. \n\nHowever, directly referencing memory addresses is very cumbersome due to at least two reasons: 1. Memory addresses are difficult to use in coding programs. An analogy is that it would be a lot easier to find people's phone number from today's smartphone systems using their names. 2. When addressing the memory, the memory address cannot be the only information. There is a whole list of other attributes Python requires to know to be able to properly retrieve the data from memory. One of such attributes is the value type as we mentioned before. An analogy that continues to borrow the phone number example would be associating a phone number not only with its user name but also the user's company, address, and other information. \n\nThe concept of **variable** is created to solve the issues when a program references memory addresses to retrieve data. Let's see some examples below: ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"a = 5-2\nb = 5*a\nprint(a>b)\nprint(type(a))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this simple example, we define a variable with a word using a single letter *a*.

We can also query the type of the memory value where the variable references, as shown in the fourth statement.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Floating-Point Numbers in Python\n\nA floating-point number is a rational number representation that contains an integer part and a fractional part.

The result is equal to 0.0125, where the integer part is 0, and the fractional part is .0125.\n\nThe name \"floating point\" is so called because the same rational number can be represented by placing its decimal point at different places and then multiplied by a base-10 exponent. For example, \\\\(0.0125 = 0.125\\times 10^{-1} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-2} \\\\), etc. All three representations define the same rational number. The fact is verified in the third statement (recall \"**\" means to the power of).\n\nIn Python, the type of a floating point number is denoted as 'float'. It is stored as a class structure as the same as the 'int' type, which we will discuss in much later part of the course. Because of this notation, floating-point numbers are often simply called floats.\n\nIn addition to the typical arithmetic operators that continue to apply to floating-point calculation, such as +, -, \\*, \\\\, let us see some more examples below. The examples show that the operations of modulo, integer division, and powers are valid also to floats.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(3.14 % 2)\nprint(3.14 // 2)\nprint(3.14 ** 2 == 3.14*3.14)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-16T07:35:41.072328Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-16T07:35:41.072674Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-16T07:35:41.07775Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-16T07:35:41.072645Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-16T07:35:41.076862Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In Python and many other languages, type conversion operations are defined to convert one type of variable to another type.\n\nIn the above, we have discussed separately two types: int and float.

It can be done in two ways:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"a = 3\nprint(a*1.0)\nprint(float(a))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-16T07:38:23.150915Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-16T07:38:23.151285Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-16T07:38:23.156427Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-16T07:38:23.151255Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-16T07:38:23.155336Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We see in the above code block, an integer variable a is first defined to be equal to 3. Multiplying a by a float 1.0 will result in a float type return, but the magnitude of the result in floating-point remains the same.\n\nThe second way is to use a built-in type conversion function *float()*. As the name suggests, the function takes in an input argument. As long as this argument can be understood to be represented by a float value, the function will output a float result of that value, as shown above. The *float()* function is also called a **casting** operation.\n\nThe other direction to convert floats to ints is more complicated. The reason is that if a float contains nontrivial digits after the decimal point, then such a convertion from float to int will change the value of the input number. After the conversion, some information will be lost. Therefore, the conversion can be performed in a variety of ways, as we shall demonstrate below:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import math\n\nprint(int(4.6))\nprint(int(-4.1))\nprint(round(4.6))\nprint(round(-4.1))\nprint(math.floor(4.6))\nprint(math.floor(-4.6))\nprint(math.ceil(4.1))\nprint(math.ceil(-4.1))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-16T07:33:47.582977Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-16T07:33:47.583356Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-16T07:33:47.592585Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-16T07:33:47.583322Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-16T07:33:47.590309Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In the above code block, we see four ways a float value can be converted to int. The most important fact to remember is that, if the float value has nonzero numbers after the decimal point, then the conversion will lose information. For example, in the first case, converting 4.6 using the function *int()* returns 4, which directly takes the integer part and discard the fractional part. So *int()* is another so-called **casting function**.\n\nThe second function is *round()*. It rounds up a float to its closest int number. For example, in the code block, we see that 4.6 rounds up to 5, and -4.1 rounds up to -4.\n\nThe last two functions are retrieving the floor and ceiling integer values from floats, respectively. When we read the code, we notice that if we directly call the two functions *floor()*, *ceil()*, Python will return error:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(floor(4.6))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The difference between using *floor()* and *math.floor()* highlights the ways Python organizes its available functions into separate modules. By default, Python at launch time will only load a set of so-called built-in functions. These build-in functions include *print()*, *int()*, *float()*, and *type()* that we have learned. We will learn a lot more as the course progresses.\n\nHowever, there are vast amounts of other functions that are not part of the built-in functions. These functions are organized into modules for two main reasons: \n1. Placing more diverse functions into individual modules helps to enhance reusability of these functions, and each module can be organized in manageable size. Otherwise, consider the counter-example if all Python functions are stored in a single file, then this file would be impossibly large to store and load.\n2. The action to **import** modules allows users to define and release their own modules. In fact, the real power of Python in the AI era has been that a lot of very powerful new modules have been open sourced by different developers. We benefit from their contributions by importing their modules in our code.\n\nSo in summary, calling *floor()* and *ceil()* functions requires the code to explicitly declare to import the *math* module. Then, *math.floor()* returns the greatest integer that is smaller than the input argument; *math.ceil()* returns the least integer that is greater than the input argument.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Random Generation of Numbers\n\nFinally, let us review a following Python code that uses randomly generated numbers and operators to test your math abilities.
